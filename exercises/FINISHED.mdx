# Beginner JavaScript 🎉

👨‍💼 **Congratulations!** You've completed the Beginner JavaScript workshop!

You've come a long way from your first `console.log()`. Let's recap everything
you've learned:

## What You've Mastered

### 1. Hello JavaScript

- Using `console.log()` to output values
- Declaring variables with `let` and `const`
- Working with strings, numbers, and booleans

### 2. Operators and Expressions

- Arithmetic operators for calculations
- Comparison operators for decisions
- Logical operators for complex conditions

### 3. Control Flow

- `if/else` statements for branching logic
- `switch` statements for multiple cases
- Ternary operator for inline conditions

### 4. Functions

- Creating reusable function declarations
- Working with parameters and return values
- Modern arrow function syntax
- Understanding variable scope

### 5. Arrays

- Creating and accessing array elements
- Using array methods like `push`, `pop`, `includes`
- Iterating with `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`

### 6. Objects

- Creating objects with key-value pairs
- Adding methods to objects
- Destructuring for cleaner code

### 7. Loops

- `for` loops for precise iteration control
- `while` loops for condition-based repetition
- `for...of` loops for clean array iteration

## What's Next?

You now have a solid foundation in JavaScript! Here are some paths you might
explore:

- **DOM Manipulation** - Make web pages interactive
- **Async JavaScript** - Handle APIs and asynchronous operations
- **React or Vue** - Build modern user interfaces
- **Node.js** - Use JavaScript on the server

## Keep Learning!

The best way to solidify your skills is to build projects. Start small:

1. Build a calculator
2. Create a todo list
3. Make a simple game
4. Build a weather app using an API
