# Hello JavaScript

👨‍💼 Excellent work! You've taken your first steps into JavaScript!

You've learned:

- 🖨️ **console.log()** - How to output values to see what your code is doing
- 📦 **Variables** - How to store and name values using `let` and `const`
- 🏷️ **Data Types** - The three basic types: strings, numbers, and booleans
- 🕳️ **Null and Undefined** - JavaScript's two "empty" values and their
  differences
- ✨ **Template Literals** - Modern string interpolation with backticks

These fundamentals are the building blocks for everything that comes next.
Remember:

- Use `const` when a value won't change
- Use `let` when you need to reassign a value
- Use `null` to intentionally represent "no value"
- Use template literals (`` `Hello, ${name}!` ``) for dynamic strings
- `console.log()` is your debugging companion

📝 Take a moment to note down anything that surprised you or that you want to
remember!
