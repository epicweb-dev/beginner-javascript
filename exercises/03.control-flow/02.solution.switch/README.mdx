# Switch Statements

👨‍💼 Nice work! Notice how we handled Saturday and Sunday together by stacking
cases:

```js
case 'Saturday':
case 'Sunday':
  console.log('Weekend!')
  break
```

This is called "fall-through" and it's one of the few times you intentionally
omit `break`.

🦉 When to use switch vs if/else:

- **Use switch** when comparing one value against several exact matches
- **Use if/else** when you have range comparisons or complex conditions

Switch is also slightly faster for many cases because JavaScript can optimize
the lookup, but for most code the difference is negligible - choose based on
readability.
