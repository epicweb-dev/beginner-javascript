# Variables

👨‍💼 We need a way to store and reuse values in our programs. Variables let us
give names to values so we can reference them later.

JavaScript has two main ways to declare variables:

- `const` - for values that won't change (constants)
- `let` - for values that might change later

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.js" /> and:

1. Create a constant called `greeting` with the value `"Hello"`
2. Create a variable called `name` with your name
3. Log both values using `console.log()`

💰 Here's the syntax:

```js
const myConstant = 'some value'
let myVariable = 'another value'
```
