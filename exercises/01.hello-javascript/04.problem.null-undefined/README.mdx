# Null and Undefined

👨‍💼 JavaScript has two special values that represent "nothing" or "no value":

- **undefined** - A variable that hasn't been assigned a value yet
- **null** - An intentional "empty" or "nothing" value

These might seem similar, but they have different meanings:

- `undefined` means "this doesn't have a value yet"
- `null` means "this intentionally has no value"

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.js" /> and explore these special values:

1. Create a variable `notAssigned` without giving it a value
2. Create a variable `intentionallyEmpty` and set it to `null`
3. Log both variables with their types using `typeof`
4. Compare them with `==` and `===` to see the difference

💰 You can declare a variable without a value:

```js
let myVariable
console.log(myVariable) // undefined
```

🦉 Fun fact: `typeof null` returns `"object"` - this is actually a bug in
JavaScript from the very first version, but it can't be fixed now because too
much code depends on it!
