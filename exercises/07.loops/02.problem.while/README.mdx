# While Loops

👨‍💼 When you don't know exactly how many iterations you need, `while` loops
continue running as long as a condition is true.

The syntax:

```js
while (condition) {
	// code to repeat
}
```

For example:

```js
let count = 0
while (count < 3) {
	console.log(count)
	count++
}
// Logs: 0, 1, 2
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.js" /> and:

1. Use a while loop to log numbers 1 through 5
2. Create a variable `sum` starting at 0, and use a while loop to add numbers 1
   through 10 to it, then log the final sum
3. Use a while loop to find the first number greater than 1 that divides evenly
   into 100 (hint: start at 2 and check `100 % number === 0`)

💰 Remember to update your counter inside the loop, or it will run forever!

	**Infinite loop warning!** If the condition never becomes false, the loop runs
	forever and crashes your program. Always ensure your loop will eventually end.
