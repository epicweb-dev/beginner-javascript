# Arrays

👨‍💼 Fantastic! You can now work with collections of data!

You've learned:

- 📝 **Creating arrays** - Using `[]` syntax
- 🔍 **Accessing elements** - Using index notation `[0]`, `[1]`, etc.
- 🛠️ **Array methods** - `push`, `pop`, `length`, `includes`
- 🔄 **Iteration** - `forEach`, `map`, `filter` for processing arrays

Key takeaways:

- Arrays are zero-indexed (first element is at index 0)
- `map` transforms each element and returns a new array
- `filter` selects elements that match a condition
- These methods don't modify the original array (they're "immutable")

📝 Array methods are used everywhere in JavaScript, especially in React and
other frameworks. Master them and you'll be much more productive!
