# Control Flow

Programs don't just run straight through - they make decisions! Control flow
statements let your code take different paths based on conditions.

## What You'll Learn

- **if/else statements** - Run code only when conditions are met
- **switch statements** - Handle multiple specific cases
- **Ternary operator** - Quick inline conditionals

## Why This Matters

Almost every useful program needs to make decisions:

- "If the user is logged in, show the dashboard"
- "If the password is wrong, show an error"
- "If it's a weekend, apply a discount"

Control flow is what makes programs smart. Instead of doing the same thing every
time, your code can respond to different situations appropriately.

Let's teach your code to think!
