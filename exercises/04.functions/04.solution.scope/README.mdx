# Variable Scope

👨‍💼 Understanding scope is crucial for writing bug-free code!

🦉 Scope rules:

1. **Inner scopes can access outer scopes** - Functions can access global
   variables
2. **Outer scopes cannot access inner scopes** - You can't access a function's
   local variables from outside
3. **Each function creates a new scope** - Variables with the same name in
   different functions are completely separate

```js
const name = 'Global'

function outer() {
	const name = 'Outer' // Different variable, shadows global

	function inner() {
		const name = 'Inner' // Different variable, shadows outer
		console.log(name) // "Inner"
	}
}
```

Avoid global variables when possible! They can be changed from anywhere, making
bugs hard to track. Prefer passing values as function parameters.
