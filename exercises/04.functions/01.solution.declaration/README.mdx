# Function Declarations

👨‍💼 You've created your first functions! Notice how you can call them multiple
times - that's the power of reusability.

🦉 Function declarations are "hoisted" in JavaScript, meaning you can call them
before they appear in the code:

```js
greet() // This works!

function greet() {
	console.log('Hello!')
}
```

This is different from other ways of defining functions (like function
expressions), which we'll see later.

Good function names are verbs that describe what the function does: `greet`,
`calculateTotal`, `validateEmail`, `fetchUser`.
