# While Loops

👨‍💼 Great! While loops are perfect when the number of iterations depends on some
condition.

🦉 There's also a `do...while` loop that runs at least once:

```js
let input
do {
	input = getInput() // Always runs at least once
} while (input !== 'quit')
```

When to use each:

| Loop | Use When |
| ---- | -------- |
| `for` | You know exactly how many iterations |
| `while` | You don't know how many iterations, check before each |
| `do...while` | You need at least one iteration, check after each |

<callout-info>
The `break` keyword immediately exits any loop:

```js
while (true) {
	if (foundIt) break // Exit the loop
}
```

The `continue` keyword skips to the next iteration:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	if (i === 5) continue // Skip 5
	console.log(i)
}
```
