# Logical Operators

👨‍💼 Excellent! You can now combine conditions to build complex logic.

🦉 Quick reference:

| A       | B       | A && B  | A \|\| B |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| `true`  | `true`  | `true`  | `true`   |
| `true`  | `false` | `false` | `true`   |
| `false` | `true`  | `false` | `true`   |
| `false` | `false` | `false` | `false`  |

<callout-info>
JavaScript uses "short-circuit evaluation": - With `&&`, if the first value is
false, JavaScript doesn't check the second - With `||`, if the first value is
true, JavaScript doesn't check the second

This becomes useful for patterns like `user && user.name` to safely access
properties.

You now have all the tools to build conditional logic!
