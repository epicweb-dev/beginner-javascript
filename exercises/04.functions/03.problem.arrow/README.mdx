# Arrow Functions

👨‍💼 Modern JavaScript has a shorter syntax for writing functions called arrow
functions. They're especially useful for short, simple functions.

The syntax:

```js
// Traditional function
function add(a, b) {
	return a + b
}

// Arrow function
const add = (a, b) => {
	return a + b
}

// Even shorter for single expressions
const add = (a, b) => a + b
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.js" /> and convert these to arrow functions:

1. Create `double` as an arrow function that takes a number and returns it
   doubled
2. Create `greet` as an arrow function that takes a name and returns
   "Hello, [name]!"
3. Create `isPositive` as an arrow function that takes a number and returns
   `true` if it's greater than 0
4. Call each function and log the results

💰 For single-expression functions, you can omit the `{}` and `return`:

```js
const square = (n) => n * n
```
