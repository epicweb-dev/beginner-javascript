# Objects

👨‍💼 Congratulations! You've completed all the JavaScript fundamentals!

You've learned:

- 🏗️ **Creating objects** - Using `{}` syntax with key-value pairs
- 🔍 **Accessing properties** - Dot notation and bracket notation
- ⚙️ **Object methods** - Functions as object properties
- 📦 **Destructuring** - Clean extraction of values

Key takeaways:

- Objects group related data with meaningful property names
- Use dot notation for known property names: `user.name`
- Use bracket notation for dynamic property names: `user[key]`
- Destructuring makes working with objects much cleaner

📝 Objects and arrays are the two fundamental data structures in JavaScript.
Combined with functions, you now have all the building blocks to write real
programs!
