# Null and Undefined

👨‍💼 Great job! You've learned about JavaScript's two "empty" values.

🦉 Key takeaways:

- `undefined` is JavaScript's default for "no value assigned"
- `null` is what you use when you want to explicitly say "no value"
- `typeof undefined` is `"undefined"`
- `typeof null` is `"object"` (a famous JavaScript quirk!)
- `null == undefined` is `true` (loose equality)
- `null === undefined` is `false` (strict equality)

<callout-warning>
	Always use `===` (strict equality) in your comparisons! Loose equality (`==`)
	has surprising behaviors that can cause bugs.

In practice, you'll see `undefined` more often - it's what you get when
accessing a property that doesn't exist or a function parameter that wasn't
passed. You'll use `null` when you want to explicitly clear a value or indicate
"nothing here on purpose."
