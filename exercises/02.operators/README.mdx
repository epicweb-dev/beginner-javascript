# Operators and Expressions

Operators are symbols that perform operations on values. They're the verbs of
programming - they make things happen!

## What You'll Learn

- **Arithmetic operators** - Math operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Comparison operators** - Comparing values with `===`, `<`, `>`
- **Logical operators** - Combining conditions with `&&`, `||`, `!`

## Why This Matters

Every program needs to:

- Calculate values (arithmetic)
- Make decisions based on conditions (comparison)
- Combine multiple conditions (logical)

These operators are the building blocks for writing programs that can make
decisions and process data.

An **expression** is any piece of code that produces a value. `2 + 2` is an
expression that produces `4`. Understanding expressions is key to understanding
how JavaScript evaluates your code.
