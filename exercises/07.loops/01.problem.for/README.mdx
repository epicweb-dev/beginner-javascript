# For Loops

👨‍💼 When you need to repeat code a specific number of times, the `for` loop is
your tool of choice.

The syntax:

```js
for (initialization; condition; update) {
	// code to repeat
}
```

For example:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	console.log(i) // Logs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

The three parts:

1. **Initialization** (`let i = 0`) - Runs once before the loop starts
2. **Condition** (`i < 5`) - Checked before each iteration; loop stops when false
3. **Update** (`i++`) - Runs after each iteration

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.js" /> and:

1. Write a for loop that logs numbers 1 through 5
2. Write a for loop that logs even numbers from 2 to 10
3. Write a for loop that counts down from 5 to 1

💰 To count by 2s, use `i += 2` in the update. To count down, start high and use
`i--`.
