# Variables

👨‍💼 Great job! You've learned how to store values in variables.

🦉 Here's when to use each:

- **Use `const`** when you know the value won't need to change. This is the
  default choice for most variables.
- **Use `let`** when you need to reassign the value later (like a counter or a
  value that updates).

A common mistake is trying to reassign a `const`:

```js
const greeting = 'Hello'
greeting = 'Hi' // ❌ Error! Can't reassign a constant
```

When in doubt, start with `const`. You can always change it to `let` if you need
to reassign it later.
