# Arithmetic Operators

👨‍💼 Great! You can now perform calculations in JavaScript.

🦉 Some things to note:

- Division always returns a decimal in JavaScript (no integer division)
- The modulo operator (`%`) is great for checking if a number is even or odd:
  `number % 2 === 0` means it's even
- You can combine operators: `(a + b) * c`

<callout-info>
JavaScript follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS): Parentheses,
Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction. Use parentheses to be
explicit about order!
