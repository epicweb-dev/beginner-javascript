# Beginner JavaScript 🟨

👨‍💼 Hello there! I'm Peter the Product Manager, and I'm excited to guide you
through your first steps into the world of JavaScript!

JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It powers interactive
websites, mobile apps, servers, and so much more. By learning JavaScript, you're
unlocking the ability to build almost anything you can imagine.

In this workshop, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript from the ground
up:

1. **Hello JavaScript** - Your first code: outputting values and storing data
2. **Operators and Expressions** - Math, comparisons, and logic
3. **Control Flow** - Making decisions with conditionals
4. **Functions** - Creating reusable blocks of code
5. **Arrays** - Working with lists of data
6. **Objects** - Organizing data with properties
7. **Loops** - Repeating code with for and while loops

	very basics and build up your skills step by step.

Each exercise introduces a new concept through hands-on practice. You'll write
real code, see it run, and build your understanding through doing.

Let's write some JavaScript! 🚀
