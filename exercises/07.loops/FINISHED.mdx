# Loops

👨‍💼 Excellent work! You now have multiple tools for iteration!

You've learned:

- 🔄 **for loops** - Precise control over iteration count
- ⏱️ **while loops** - Continue until a condition changes
- 📦 **for...of** - Clean syntax for iterating arrays

When to use each:

| Loop Type | Best For |
| --------- | -------- |
| `for` | When you need the index or specific iteration count |
| `while` | When you don't know how many iterations ahead of time |
| `for...of` | When you just need each value from an array |
| `forEach/map/filter` | When transforming or filtering arrays |

📝 Remember: with great looping power comes great responsibility. Always ensure
your loops will eventually end - infinite loops crash programs!
