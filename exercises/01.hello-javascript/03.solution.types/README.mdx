# Data Types

👨‍💼 Excellent! You now know the three fundamental data types in JavaScript.

🦉 Understanding types is important because:

- Different types behave differently (you can't do math on strings!)
- Knowing the type helps you predict what operations are available
- Many bugs come from unexpected types

	JavaScript is "dynamically typed" - variables can hold any type, and the type
	can change. This is different from languages like Java or C++ where you
	declare the type upfront.

There are more types in JavaScript (like `undefined`, `null`, `object`, and
`symbol`), but strings, numbers, and booleans are the building blocks you'll use
most often.
