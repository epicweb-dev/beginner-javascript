# Template Literals

👨‍💼 Awesome! Template literals are one of the most useful features in modern
JavaScript.

🦉 Why template literals are better than string concatenation:

```js
// Old way (harder to read)
const message = 'Hello, ' + name + '! You are ' + age + ' years old.'

// Template literal way (much cleaner!)
const message = `Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`
```

	Template literals preserve whitespace and newlines exactly as you write them.
	This makes them perfect for creating formatted text, HTML templates, or SQL
	queries.

You'll use template literals constantly in JavaScript:

- Building dynamic messages
- Creating HTML strings
- Logging debug information
- Formatting data for display

Now you have a complete toolkit for working with strings!
