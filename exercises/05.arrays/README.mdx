# Arrays

Arrays are ordered lists of values. They're one of the most important data
structures in JavaScript and are used constantly in real applications.

## What You'll Learn

- **Creating and accessing arrays** - Store and retrieve multiple values
- **Array methods** - Built-in functions to modify arrays
- **Iteration** - Loop through arrays with `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`

## Why This Matters

Real programs deal with collections of data:

- A list of users
- Shopping cart items
- Search results
- Form field values

Arrays let you store multiple values in a single variable and perform operations
on all of them efficiently.
