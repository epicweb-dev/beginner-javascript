# Control Flow

👨‍💼 Wonderful! Your code can now make decisions!

You've learned:

- 🔀 **if/else** - The foundation of conditional logic
- 🎯 **switch** - Clean handling of multiple specific cases
- ❓ **Ternary** - Compact inline conditions

When to use each:

- **if/else** - Most situations, especially complex conditions
- **switch** - When comparing one value against many possibilities
- **ternary** - Simple either/or assignments

📝 Practice combining these with the operators you learned earlier. The
combination of operators and control flow is incredibly powerful!
