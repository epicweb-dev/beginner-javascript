# console.log

👨‍💼 Perfect! You've written your first line of JavaScript!

`console.log()` is one of the most useful tools you'll use. It lets you see
what's happening in your code at any point. You'll use it constantly for:

- Debugging (figuring out why something isn't working)
- Understanding how your code flows
- Displaying results of calculations

🦉 Pro tip: You can log multiple values at once by separating them with commas:

```js
console.log('The answer is:', 42)
```
