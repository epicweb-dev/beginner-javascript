# Conditionals

👨‍💼 Your code can now make decisions based on values!

🦉 Important notes about if/else:

- Conditions are checked in order - once one is true, the rest are skipped
- The `else` block is optional - use it for a "fallback" case
- You can nest if statements inside each other (but don't go too deep!)

<callout-info>
The order of conditions matters! If we checked `score >= 70` first, a score of
95 would show "C" because 95 >= 70 is true. Always check the most specific
conditions first.

Try changing the `score` value and running the code again to see different
grades!
