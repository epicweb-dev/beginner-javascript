# Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code. Instead of writing the same code
repeatedly, you write it once in a function and call it whenever you need it.

## What You'll Learn

- **Function declarations** - Creating named functions
- **Parameters and returns** - Passing data in and getting results out
- **Arrow functions** - Modern, concise function syntax
- **Scope** - Understanding where variables are accessible

## Why This Matters

Functions are the building blocks of any program. They help you:

- **Avoid repetition** - Write once, use many times
- **Organize code** - Group related logic together
- **Abstract complexity** - Hide details behind a simple name
- **Test easily** - Isolated units of code are easier to test

Think of functions as recipes: you define the steps once, then follow them
whenever you need to make that dish.
