# Hello JavaScript

Welcome to your first JavaScript exercise! In this exercise, you'll learn the
very basics of working with JavaScript: outputting values to the console and
storing data in variables.

## What You'll Learn

- How to use `console.log()` to output values
- Declaring variables with `let` and `const`
- The basic data types: strings, numbers, and booleans
- The special values `null` and `undefined`
- Template literals for powerful string formatting

## Why This Matters

Every program needs to communicate. Whether it's displaying information to a
user, saving data for later, or debugging your code, understanding how to output
values and store data is fundamental to everything you'll build.

`console.log()` will become your best friend for understanding what your code is
doing. Variables let you give names to values so you can use them throughout
your program.

Let's write your first lines of JavaScript!
