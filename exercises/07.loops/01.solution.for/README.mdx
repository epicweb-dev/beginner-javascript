# For Loops

👨‍💼 Great work! You can now control exactly how many times code runs.

🦉 Common for loop patterns:

```js
// Loop through an array by index
const items = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
	console.log(i, items[i])
}

// Loop backwards
for (let i = items.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
	console.log(items[i])
}

// Loop with a step
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i += 10) {
	console.log(i) // 0, 10, 20, ...
}
```

Be careful with your loop condition! `i <= 5` includes 5, while `i < 5` stops at
4. Off-by-one errors are one of the most common bugs in programming.
