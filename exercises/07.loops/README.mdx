# Loops

Loops let you repeat code multiple times. Instead of writing the same code over
and over, you can tell JavaScript to run it as many times as you need.

## What You'll Learn

- **for loops** - Run code a specific number of times
- **while loops** - Run code while a condition is true
- **for...of loops** - Iterate through arrays elegantly

## Why This Matters

Loops are essential when working with collections of data:

- Process every item in a shopping cart
- Validate each field in a form
- Display a list of search results
- Repeat an action until a goal is reached

Combined with arrays and the iteration methods you learned earlier, loops give
you complete control over repetitive tasks.

Let's learn to make JavaScript do the repetitive work for us!
