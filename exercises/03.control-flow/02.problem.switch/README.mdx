# Switch Statements

👨‍💼 When you're comparing one value against many specific possibilities, a
`switch` statement is cleaner than many if/else statements.

The syntax:

```js
switch (value) {
	case 'option1':
		// code for option1
		break
	case 'option2':
		// code for option2
		break
	default:
		// code if no case matches
}
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.js" /> and:

1. Create a variable `day` with a day name like `"Monday"`
2. Write a switch statement that logs:
   - "Start of work week" for Monday
   - "Midweek" for Wednesday
   - "Almost there!" for Friday
   - "Weekend!" for Saturday or Sunday
   - "Regular day" for anything else

💰 Don't forget the `break` statement after each case, or execution will "fall
through" to the next case!

<callout-warning>
Missing `break` is a common bug! Each case needs `break` unless you intentionally
want fall-through behavior.
