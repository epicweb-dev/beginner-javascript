# Operators and Expressions

👨‍💼 Fantastic work! You've mastered the fundamental operators in JavaScript.

You've learned:

- ➕ **Arithmetic** - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` for math operations
- ⚖️ **Comparison** - `===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` for comparing values
- 🔗 **Logical** - `&&`, `||`, `!` for combining conditions

Key takeaways:

- Always use `===` instead of `==` for comparisons
- `&&` requires ALL conditions to be true
- `||` requires ANY condition to be true
- `!` flips true to false and vice versa

📝 These operators will appear in almost every JavaScript program you write.
Make sure you're comfortable with how they work!
