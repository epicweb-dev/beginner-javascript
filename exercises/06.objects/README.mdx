# Objects

Objects are collections of key-value pairs. While arrays store ordered lists,
objects store named properties - perfect for representing real-world things.

## What You'll Learn

- **Creating and accessing objects** - Store related data together
- **Object methods** - Functions that belong to objects
- **Destructuring** - Extract values from objects and arrays elegantly

## Why This Matters

Objects are everywhere in JavaScript:

- A user has a name, email, and age
- A product has a title, price, and description
- An API response contains multiple related pieces of data

Objects let you group related data under meaningful names, making your code more
organized and readable.

Let's learn to work with structured data!
