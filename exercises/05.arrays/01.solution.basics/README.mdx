# Array Basics

👨‍💼 Great! You can now create and access array elements.

🦉 Important notes about arrays:

- **Zero-indexed** - The first element is at index `0`, not `1`
- **Dynamic size** - Arrays can grow and shrink
- **Mixed types** - Arrays can hold different types: `[1, "hello", true]` (though
  this is usually not recommended)

Getting the last element is a common pattern:

```js
const last = array[array.length - 1]

// Or with modern JavaScript:
const last = array.at(-1) // Negative indices count from the end!
```

<callout-info>
Even though we declared `colors` with `const`, we can still modify its contents.
`const` only prevents reassigning the variable itself, not mutating the array.
