# Conditionals

👨‍💼 We need our program to respond differently based on conditions. The `if`
statement lets us run code only when a condition is true.

The syntax:

```js
if (condition) {
	// runs if condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
	// runs if first is false, this is true
} else {
	// runs if all conditions are false
}
```

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.js" /> and:

1. Create a variable `score` with a number between 0 and 100
2. Write an if/else if/else chain that logs:
   - "A" if score is 90 or above
   - "B" if score is 80 or above
   - "C" if score is 70 or above
   - "F" otherwise

💰 Start with:

```js
if (score >= 90) {
	console.log('A')
}
```

Then add the `else if` and `else` branches.
