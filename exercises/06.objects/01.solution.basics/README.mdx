# Object Basics

👨‍💼 Great! You can now create and work with objects.

🦉 When to use each notation:

**Dot notation** (`object.property`):

- When you know the exact property name
- Cleaner and more common

**Bracket notation** (`object["property"]`):

- When the property name is in a variable
- When property names have special characters or spaces

```js
const key = 'name'
console.log(person[key]) // Dynamic property access

const weird = { 'full name': 'John Doe' }
console.log(weird['full name']) // Spaces in property name
```

Like arrays, objects declared with `const` can still have their properties
modified. `const` only prevents reassigning the variable itself.
