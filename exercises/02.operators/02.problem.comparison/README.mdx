# Comparison Operators

👨‍💼 Programs need to compare values to make decisions. Comparison operators
return `true` or `false` based on how values relate to each other.

The comparison operators are:

- `===` Strict equality (same value AND same type)
- `!==` Strict inequality (not equal)
- `<` Less than
- `>` Greater than
- `<=` Less than or equal
- `>=` Greater than or equal

🐨 Open <InlineFile file="index.js" /> and:

1. Create variables `x = 5` and `y = 10`
2. Log whether `x` equals `y` using `===`
3. Log whether `x` is less than `y`
4. Log whether `x` is greater than or equal to `5`
5. Log whether `y` is not equal to `x`

💰 Comparison expressions return booleans:

```js
console.log(5 === 5) // true
console.log(5 < 3) // false
```

<callout-warning>
	Always use `===` (strict equality), not `==` (loose equality). Loose equality
	does type coercion which can lead to unexpected results!
