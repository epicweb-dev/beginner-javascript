# Object Methods

👨‍💼 Great! You've created methods that operate on object data.

🦉 The `this` keyword:

Inside a method, `this` refers to the object the method belongs to. This lets
methods access and use the object's other properties.

```js
const counter = {
	count: 0,
	increment() {
		this.count += 1
		return this.count
	},
	decrement() {
		this.count -= 1
		return this.count
	},
}
```

<callout-warning>
	Arrow functions handle `this` differently! They don't have their own `this`,
	so avoid using arrow functions for object methods that need to access `this`.
</callout-warning>

```js
// ❌ Don't do this
const obj = {
	name: 'Alice',
	greet: () => 'Hi, ' + this.name, // `this` won't work as expected!
}

// ✅ Do this
const obj = {
	name: 'Alice',
	greet() {
		return 'Hi, ' + this.name
	},
}
```
